## Developing PyTorch
Follow the instructions for [installing PyTorch from source](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch#from-source). If you get stuck when developing PyTorch on your machine, check out the [tips and debugging](#tips-and-debugging) section below for common solutions.

### Tips and Debugging

* If you want to have no-op incremental rebuilds (which are fast), see [Make no-op build fast](#make-no-op-build-fast) below.

* When installing with `python setup.py develop` (in contrast to `python setup.py install`) you will symlink
   the Python files from the current local source-tree into the Python install.
  This way you do not need to repeatedly install after modifying Python files (`.py`).
  However, you would need to reinstall if you modify Python interface (`.pyi`, `.pyi.in`) or
   non-Python files (`.cpp`, `.cc`, `.cu`, `.h`, ...).

  To reinstall, first uninstall all existing PyTorch installs. You may need to run `pip
  uninstall torch` multiple times. You'll know `torch` is fully
  uninstalled when you see `WARNING: Skipping torch as it is not
  installed`. (You should only have to `pip uninstall` a few times, but
  you can always `uninstall` with `timeout` or in a loop if you're feeling
  lazy.)

  ```bash
  conda uninstall pytorch -y
  yes | pip uninstall torch
  ```

  Next run `python setup.py clean`. After that, you can install in `develop` mode again.

* If a commit is simple and doesn't affect any code (keep in mind that some docstrings contain code
  that is used in tests), you can add `[skip ci]` (case sensitive) somewhere in your commit message to
  [skip all build / test steps](https://github.blog/changelog/2021-02-08-github-actions-skip-pull-request-and-push-workflows-with-skip-ci/).
  Note that changing the pull request body or title on GitHub itself has no effect.

* If you run into errors when running `python setup.py develop`, here are some debugging steps:
  1. Run `printf '#include <stdio.h>\nint main() { printf("Hello World");}'|clang -x c -; ./a.out` to make sure
  your CMake works and can compile this simple Hello World program without errors.
  2. Nuke your `build` directory. The `setup.py` script compiles binaries into the `build` folder and caches many
  details along the way, which saves time the next time you build. If you're running into issues, you can always
  `rm -rf build` from the toplevel `pytorch` directory and start over.
  3. If you have made edits to the PyTorch repo, commit any change you'd like to keep and clean the repo with the
  following commands (note that clean _really_ removes all untracked files and changes.):
      ```bash
      git submodule deinit -f .
      git clean -xdf
      python setup.py clean
      git submodule update --init --recursive # very important to sync the submodules
      python setup.py develop                 # then try running the command again
      ```
  4. The main step within `python setup.py develop` is running `make` from the `build` directory. If you want to
    experiment with some environment variables, you can pass them into the command:
      ```bash
      ENV_KEY1=ENV_VAL1[, ENV_KEY2=ENV_VAL2]* python setup.py develop
      ```

* If you run into issue running `git submodule update --init --recursive`. Please try the following:
  - If you encounter an error such as
    ```
    error: Submodule 'third_party/pybind11' could not be updated
    ```
    check whether your Git local or global config file contains any `submodule.*` settings. If yes, remove them and try again.
    (please reference [this doc](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config#Documentation/git-config.txt-submoduleltnamegturl) for more info).

  - If you encounter an error such as
    ```
    fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/pybind11/pybind11.git': could not load PEM client certificate ...
    ```
    this is likely that you are using HTTP proxying and the certificate expired. To check if the certificate is valid, run
    `git config --global --list` and search for config like `http.proxysslcert=<cert_file>`. Then check certificate valid date by running
    ```bash
    openssl x509 -noout -in <cert_file> -dates
    ```

  - If you encounter an error that some third_party modules are not checked out correctly, such as
    ```
    Could not find .../pytorch/third_party/pybind11/CMakeLists.txt
    ```
    remove any `submodule.*` settings in your local git config (`.git/config` of your pytorch repo) and try again.
